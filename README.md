# Project-Chao
Translation is only better when shared

## Why 'Chao'?

Scenarior: An old man Vietnamese comes to Japan for Olympic 2020, have no idea what neither the Japanese Language is nor English. Even if the *Sign* are everywhere, he still needs some helps.

There is one solution: ask Google Translate to translate his words and give them to the local people. While Google Translate is not that bad in general, it is known as not that *Good* at some languages including *Vietnamese*. Furthermore, even if people could still give another translation to make it better, the lack of *Community* and *Evaluation* decrease the quality of those translation.

*Chao* is a *Community* with *Evaluation* for *Real-life* translation.

*Give and receive* is the key idea.
